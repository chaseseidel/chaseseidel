### 👋 Hi, My name is Chase Seidel.
#### I'm a full-stack engineer focused on building performant, scalable apps that actually solve real-world problems.

🔧 I mostly work with TypeScript, React, Supabase, and PostgreSQL. I care deeply about developer experience, clean abstractions, and intuitive UI/UX.

🚀 Projects I’ve built include:

A real-time tryout evaluation platform used across 4 club locations for 800+ athletes per season

Workflow tools for field service operations: work orders, proposals, digital signatures, payment integrations

Internal tools like schedulers, metadata-driven file services, and approval systems

🏐 Off the keyboard, I coach youth volleyball—leading top-ranked teams and building systems for player development and evaluation.

💬 Open to collaboration and always happy to talk shop.
